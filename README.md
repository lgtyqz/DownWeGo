# Down We Go
A roguelike for the masses, that anyone can pick up and instantly understand.

## How to Play
Arrow keys - move, which leaves a trail of walls behind
Z - special, depends on ability.
Standard Z spawns walls.
X - one-use shovel
C - freeze all enemies for 5 turns (they can't hurt you while frozen)
