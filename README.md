# Down We Go
A roguelike for the masses, that anyone can pick up and instantly understand.

## How to Play
#### Arrow keys - move, which leaves a trail of walls behind
#### Z - special, depends on ability. (Standard Z spawns walls.)
#### X - one-use shovel
#### C - freeze all enemies for 5 turns (they can't hurt you while frozen)
#### Quick Mode: all transition animations take 1 frame instead of 20.
#### Difficulty: Just choose 0. 1 gives checkpoints every 5 levels, 2 doesn't give any checkpoints.
#### Speedrun Mode: Checkpoints every 5 levels, stops at floor 50. Seeds can be literally any text. Even lennies. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
#### Switch Ability: Just play around with this. ;) (Sigma ability is the easiest mode, Omega is by far the hardest)
