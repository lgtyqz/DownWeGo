# Down We Go
A roguelike for the masses, that anyone can pick up and instantly understand.

## How to Play
#### Arrow keys - move, which leaves a trail of walls behind
#### Z - special, depends on ability. (Standard Z spawns walls.)
#### X - one-use shovel
#### C - freeze all enemies for 5 turns (they can't hurt you while frozen)
#### Quick Mode: all transition animations take 1 frame instead of 20.
#### Difficulty: Just choose 0. 1 gives checkpoints every 5 levels, 2 doesn't give any checkpoints.
#### Speedrun Mode: Checkpoints every 5 levels, stops at floor 50. Seeds can be literally any text. Even lennies. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
#### Switch Ability: Just play around with this. ;) (Sigma ability is the easiest mode, Omega is by far the hardest)


ABILITY INFO BELOW
  - Beta: Creates a box made out of walls to trap enemies. MODERATE
  - Sigma: Jump two squares in the direction you are facing, if the square is available (you can jump over walls). Digs the next tile in the specified direction. EASY
  - Delta: You move diagonally. You can move through walls if the square you are about to move to is available. HARD
  - Null: Beta, but with NO TRAILS. Hybrids are stunned for 8 beats instead of 4. HARD
  - Bracket: The box is larger and is shaped like a bracket. MODERATE
  - Lucifer: Limited vision, but you get a permanent shovel. MODERATE
  - Braille: Everything is a black square. (TODO: +1 freeze every level, since enemies could be disguised as walls) HARD
  - TRANS: The special button fires a straight beam that will degrade enemies that come in contact with it, eventually turning them into mere walls. However, the beam is stopped by walls. EASY at first, then INSANE
  - Omega: Kind of a combination of TRANS and Beta. Every other tile from the player's position is flipped—walls are dug, and empty spaces spawn walls. VERY, VERY HARD (Good luck just passing floor 1.)
